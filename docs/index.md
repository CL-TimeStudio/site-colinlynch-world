# Brief Intro

**Founder · Cognitive Integrator · Independent Researcher**

Welcome to my personal page. I work at the intersection of systems design, artificial intelligence, and time-based theoretical frameworks. My focus is on understanding how people, processes, and technologies evolve over time — and how those patterns can be shaped, improved, or understood more clearly.

This site offers a simple overview of where my current work lives, along with links to the organizations and research spaces I maintain.

## What I Do
I build frameworks — technical, behavioral, and conceptual — that explore:

- How intelligent systems learn through behavior and feedback  
- How long-term memory and process understanding shape AI  
- How temporal structures influence physical and conceptual systems  

Much of this work spans both applied AI and speculative research. I keep the two worlds intentionally separate:

- **Temvorn** handles applied AI and behavioral learning systems  
- **Temporal Sciences Foundation** supports speculative theoretical work  

This page is simply the personal hub tying it together.

## Current Focus Areas

### Temvorn (Applied AI)
I lead the development of frameworks that help AI systems understand process, behavior, and change over time. The goal is to move AI beyond static outputs toward adaptive, transparent learning systems.

### Temporal Sciences Foundation
I founded the Temporal Sciences Foundation to support speculative work exploring time as a structural principle of the universe. All work is shared openly as non-peer-reviewed documents to encourage examination, refinement, and critique.

- **Visit [Temporal Sciences Wiki](https://www.temporalsciences.wiki)**

## Documents & Open Access
All speculative work is openly available through Zenodo in document form (not publications), in recognition of the rigor required for formal peer review.

## Generative AI “Start Here” Website
- **Visit [ColinLynch.ai](https://www.colinlynch.ai)**  
  A simple starting point for people who haven’t yet begun working with generative AI.

## A Few Guiding Principles
- Clarity over complexity  
- Process over outcomes  
- Behavior precedes learning  
- Respect for peer review  
- Humility in uncertain domains  

These principles guide both my applied AI work and my speculative research.
